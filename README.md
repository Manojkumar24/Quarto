# Quarto

Quarto is a board game for two players played on a 4Ã—4 board. There are 16 unique pieces to play with, each of which is either:
1. tall or short;
2. red or blue
3. square or circular; and
4. hollow-top or solid-top.

Players take turns choosing a piece which the other player must then place on the board. A player wins by placing a piece on the board which forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of four pieces, all of which have a common attribute (all short, all circular, etc.).

Run Quarto.py file to start the game in single or multi-player mode.
